# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `guard/` group keeps the agent loop productive by watching for three failure patterns. `repeat-tool-reminder` notices an exact repeated tool call and reminds the model to change approach or finish. `no-progress-reminder` notices an active goal with no file mutation across whole turns and reminds the model to read, edit, write, or bash, or to say what blocks it. `timeout-policy` limits tool calls that declare a timeout, so a hung call returns a timed-out error instead of stalling the session. All three ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; a composition can tune or remove them.

## Packages

Three small plugins cover the three patterns; each README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`no-progress-reminder/`](no-progress-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when a goal stays active for whole turns with no file mutation |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
